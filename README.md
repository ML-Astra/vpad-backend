# TO BE NAMED

A website dedicated to hosting indie animation and all that relates to it: the films themselves, merch, fundraising and subscriptions, both free and paid.
The main reason I think this is a good idea is because a percentage of the money, currently, goes to YouTube (and by extension Google and Alphabet), merch shop hosts, Patreon and whatever else, and I personally think moving away from that and into a platform that actually cares about its creators is a huge step forward in both of our industries, for indie animation, hopefully higher profits and less money being wasted on MegaCorps, and for software development, if this were to succeed, of actually doing something meaningful in the face of one of the biggest online entities (YouTube).
